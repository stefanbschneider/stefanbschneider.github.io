# Experience 

### 2017-Present: PhD Researcher, Computer Networks Group, Paderborn University, Germany.

Research focusing on network function virtualization (NFV), 5G, could, and AI

* Completed research:
  - Devised novel approach for generic, yet precise specification of complex network services
  - Developed a multi-objective optimization algorithm for network service orchestration
  - Designed a framework for reusing and evaluating different orchestration algorithms
  - Investigated fundamental trade-offs in dynamic resource allocation (NFV, cloud) 
* Ongoing and future research:
  - Investigating predictive and pro-active service orchestration using machine learning
  - Developing a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach for service orchestration
  - Creating a network simulation environment for training and evaluating RL agents
  - Introducing fault injection for training and evaluating fault-tolerant orchestration

### 2015-2016: Student Researcher (MSc), Distributed Systems Group, Paderborn University, Germany

* Implemented and evaluated protocols for vehicular communication using simulation
* Developed an ideal “oracle” protocol for assessing a protocol’s optimality gap
* Improved simulation performance by optimizing data base indexing and operations

### April-Jul 2014: Student Teaching Assistant (BSc), Computer Networks Group, Paderborn University, Germany

Taught 2 weekly tutorials for ~20 undergraduate students on systems software for 1 semester

### 2012-2013: Student Teaching Assistant (BSc), Databases and Electronic-Commerce Group, Paderborn University, Germany

Taught 1 weekly tutorial for ~20 undergraduate students on Java basics for 1 semester
