## RealVNF: Improved coordination of chained VNFs under realistic conditions (Software Campus)

Website: [https://realvnf.github.io/](https://realvnf.github.io/)

Project duration: 2018-2020

RealVNF is a 2-year project (11/2018 to 10/2020) that is funded by the BMBF and part of the [Software Campus](https://www.softwarecampus.de/en/), which means that I manage and lead the entire project - from applying for a grant, over recruiting student researchers, to collaborating with researchers from Huawei.

The goal of the project is to design and develop concepts and  algorithms to improve coordination of chained virtual network functions  (VNFs) under realistic conditions to take cloud computing and network  softwarization to the next level.

In collaboration with Huawei, we try to focus on practical  applicability and usefulness, while combining it with new research ideas  and approaches. A current focus is on combining classical networking  with deep reinforcement learning approaches.

## 5GTANGO: 5G Development and validation platform for global industry-specific network services and apps

Website: [https://5gtango.eu/](https://5gtango.eu/)

Project duration: 2017-2020

[5GTANGO](https://5gtango.eu/) is a European H2020 project focusing on flexible programmability of 5G networks by offering an NFV SDK for development support, a verification and validation platform, and a service platform for deployment. The project outcomes are demonstrated using three vertical pilots (smart manufacturing, immersive media, real-time communication).

In 5GTANGO, I work on evolving the SDK by developing new tools like the service [descriptor generator](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-descriptorgen) as well as refactoring and extending existing ones like the [project management tool](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-project), which support service developers in quickly creating suitable descriptors that are required for deployment. I also help designing and developing the [smart manufacturing pilot](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-industrial-pilot) use cases and corresponding network functions.

## OpenC2X: An Open Source Experimental and Prototyping Platform Supporting ETSI ITS-G5 (Vehicular Networking)

Website: [http://www.ccs-labs.org/software/openc2x/](http://www.ccs-labs.org/software/openc2x/)

Project duration: 2015-2016

Vehicular networking is at the corner from early research to final  deployment. This phase requires more field testing and real-world  experimentation. Most Field Operational Tests (FOTs) are based on  proprietary commercial hardware that only allows for marginal  modifications of the protocol stack. Furthermore, the roll-out of  updated implementations for new or changing protocol standards often  takes a prohibitively long time.

We developed one of the first  complete Open Source experimental and prototyping platform for vehicular  networking solutions. Our system supports most of the ETSI ITS-G5  features and runs on standard Linux. New protocol features and updates  could now easily be done by and shared with the vehicular networking  R&D community.
