Since my PhD position is currently entirely funded through the [European H2020 project 5GTANGO](http://5gtango.eu/), I do not have teaching obligations. However, I do help in preparing, executing, and grading both written and oral exams in the networking and programming lectures of my research group. Furthermore, I supervised/advised several students in bachelor's or master's theses, projects, seminars, or classes.

*I currently advise 25 students (last updated 19.4.19):*

* 3 master's theses, 1 bachelor's thesis, and 2 graduate seminar theses
* 3 research assistants in my RealVNF Software Campus project
* 3 research assistants in the 5GTANGO H2020 project (together with a colleague)
* Group of 13 students in 1-year graduate project (together with a colleague)

# Student projects

* 2019-2020: [BAcKFLiP: Benchmarking network functions to collect the world largest NFV performance dataset](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/cn/teaching/theses-student-projects/student-project-groups-ongoing/backflip/) (1-year master's student project)

# Theses

* Master's thesis (ongoing): "Using Queuing Petri Nets in a Scaling and Placing Algorithm for Chains of Virtual Network Functions" by Peter Steinberg

# Classes

* 2019:
  * Master's seminar on network softwarization: Supervised 2 students with topics on reinforcement learning in network management
* 2018: 
  * [Model-based software engineering](https://mde-lab-sessions.github.io/running-example-for-lecture/#mbse): Advised 4 students as "domain expert" to develop a domain-specific language for specifying network services
  * [Master's seminar on network softwarization](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/cn/teaching/courses/prior-terms/ss-2018/pro-seminar-rechnernetze/): Supervised 3 students with topics on predictive service placement

Before starting my PhD, during my bachelor's, I held exercise lessons for two lectures as student teaching assistant:

* April - July 2014, [Systems software](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/cn/teaching/courses/konzepte-und-methoden-der-systemsoftware/), Paderborn University
* October 2012 - February 2013, Programming basics (Java), Paderborn University

## Other

* Since 2017: Mentor for undergraduate/bachelor students with meetings every semester
