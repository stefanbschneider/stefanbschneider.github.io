# Classes

* 2019:
  * Master's seminar on network softwarization: Supervised 2 students with topics on reinforcement learning in network management
* 2018: 
  * [Model-based software engineering](https://mde-lab-sessions.github.io/running-example-for-lecture/#mbse): Advised 4 students as "domain expert" to develop a domain-specific language for specifying network services
  * [Master's seminar on network softwarization](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/cn/teaching/courses/prior-terms/ss-2018/pro-seminar-rechnernetze/): Supervised 3 students with topics on predictive service placement

Before starting my PhD, during my bachelor's, I held exercise lessons for two lectures as student teaching assistant:

* April - July 2014, [Systems software](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/cn/teaching/courses/konzepte-und-methoden-der-systemsoftware/), Paderborn University
* October 2012 - February 2013, Programming basics (Java), Paderborn University

## Other

* Since 2017: Mentor for undergraduate/bachelor students with meetings every semester
