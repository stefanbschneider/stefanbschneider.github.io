**TODO**: More details, ongoing projects (Tango, RealVNF), PhD since 2017, ...

I'm a PhD researcher at the computer networks group at Paderborn University. My research focus is on network softwarization and cloud computing, but I am also interested in machine learning and applying it to the networking domain.

## Projects

### 5GTANGO: 5G Development and validation platform for global industry-specific network services and apps

[5GTANGO](https://5gtango.eu/) is a European H2020 project focusing on flexible programmability of 5G networks by offering an NFV SDK for development support, a verification and validation platform, and a service platform for deployment. The project outcomes are demonstrated using three vertical pilots (smart manufacturing, immersive media, real-time communication).

In 5GTANGO, I work on evolving the SDK by developing new tools like the service [descriptor generator](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-descriptorgen) as well as refactoring and extending existing ones like the [project management tool](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-project), which support service developers in quickly creating suitable descriptors that are required for deployment. I also help designing and developing the [smart manufacturing pilot](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-industrial-pilot) use cases and corresponding network functions.

My work in 5GTANGO involves (among others) the following technologies and languages: Python, JavaScript, OpenAPI/Swagger, Docker, Kubernetes, YAML/JSON schemas.
